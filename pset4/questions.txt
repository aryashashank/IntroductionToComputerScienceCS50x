0.  How many different colors does each format support?
Ans. JPG :  16.7 million colors.
     GIF :  256 colors.
     PNG format supports 8-bit color but also extends it to 24-bits so supports upto 16.7 million colors.
     BMP : 24 bit bmp supports 16.7 million colors.

1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
Ans. GIF supports animation.

2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
Ans. Lossy compression :  
     Lossy compression, as its name implies, does not encode all the information of the file, 
     so when it is recovered into an image, it will not be an exact representation of the original. 
     However, it is able to compress images very effectively compared to lossless formats, 
     as it discards certain information.  
     A prime example of a lossy compression format is JPEG. 
     
     Lossless compression :
      lossless compression will encode all the information from the original,
      so when the image is decompressed, it will be an exact representation of the original.
      As there is no loss of information in lossless compression,
      it is not able to achieve as high a compression as lossy compression, in most cases.
      Examples of lossless image compression is PNG and GIF.

3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
Ans. JPEG supports lossy compression.

4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
Ans.When the operating system erases a FAT file, two
    things occur. First, the system modifies the filename’s first
    character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
    to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file
    data is never touched.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
Ans. Many individuals prefer to sanitize hard-drive information by intentionally
     overwriting that data with other data so that the
     original data cannot be recovered. So this is what someone like me would do.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
6.  What’s stdint.h?
Ans. stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced
     in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code
     by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, 
     together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros .
     For example int8_t and uint64_t amongst others could be declared
     together with defining their corresponding ranges INT8_MIN to INT8_MAX and 0 (zero) to UINT64_MAX.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans. These are used to manually define datatypes in our program, so as to give our variables a specific size
     without typecasting it to predefind datatypes like int or char.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans. BYTE : 1 byte.
     DWORD : 4 bytes.
     LONG : 4 bytes.
     WORD : 2 bytes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Ans. 0x4d42
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans. bfsize : Size in BYTES of the file.
     bisize : Size of rest of header. Set to 40.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Ans. BitsPerPixel which is a 16 bit field.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
Ans. If the file cannot be opened properly, null is returned.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans. Because we are reading 1 block of given size at a time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans. 3.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. What does fseek do?
Ans. fseek is used to move the file pointer manually according to requirement.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans. SEEK_CUR is where the file pointer is currently pointing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Whodunit?
Ans. Rick Astley.
